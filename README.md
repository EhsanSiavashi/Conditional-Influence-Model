# Stochastic Modeling of Network Interactions: The Conditional Influence Model

The conditional Influence Model (CIM) is an extension of the Influence Model (IM) introduced by C. Asavathiratham from MIT in 2001. Influence Model is a tractable stochastic model for modeling dynamics of networked Markov Chains (MC). For more information about the influence model please visit [DSpace@MIT](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/33546).

The Conditional Influence Model was introduced by Ehsan Siavashi and Dr. Mahshid Naeni from [DSNL](http://myweb.ttu.edu/marahnam/Files/ResearchGroup/DSNL.htm) lab in Texas Tech University and adds the following unique features: (1) The dynamics of components can vary in time, for instance, based on the internal on their past interactions, and (2) depending on the state of the components the influences among components may get activated or deactivated (rule-based interactions). For more information, link to the related publications will be available soon in this website.

Both IM and CIM are based on the idea that the next state of a node depends on its own MC and also the influences that each node receives from its neighbors.
